# Games by toadkarter
##### This repository is for games that I developed in the Unity game engine. These games have are built using Unity's WebGL module and as such are fully playable within your browser window. Currently only desktop / laptop support is provided but I may update to be playable on tablets / phones in the future. 
##### Please see below for list of games and instructions on how to play!

##### Wobbly Fowl is my attempt to recreate a Flappy Bird style game without the use of specific tutorials. This is also my first time at attempting to create my own pixel art and animations. In a future update, I will be attempting to increase the difficulty of the game as the player's gameplay time increases. 

# Monster Chase
### [CLICK ME TO PLAY!](https://toadkarter.github.io/Gamez-Playable/MonsterChase/index.html)
##### Controls: Press Left and Right to move, Space to jump!

##### Monster Chase is a short platformer style game developed by following along with freeCodeCamp's wonderful tutorial on Unity for beginners ([Link Here](youtube.com/watch?v=gB1F9G0JXOo)). All credit to assets and animations go to freeCodeCamp. I used this project to refresh myself on how Unity works after several months of not using the engine.
